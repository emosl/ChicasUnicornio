                <p> As this game proceeds the screen advances with Toby.
                     Each level is made up out of 5 different maps, and they will be placed randomly every 
                     time you play the level. </p>
                <p> Along the way there are bombs, ice zones, water pits and gigant rocks. 
                    The items will help you overcome each obstacle, be careful, you need different 
                    statistics to be able to go through them.  </p>
                <p> In the fith area of every level Toby will face the Evil Equine, make sure to equip with the right 
                    items in order to defeat him and move on to the next level.
                    Whether or not Toby makes it to the Pegassus world depends on you. 
                    You're going to need sharp wits to complete this quest, good luck!  </p>
