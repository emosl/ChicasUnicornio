            <h2 id="sub"> A Pegasus Chronicles </h2>
            <p> Toby is a pegasus that fell into the trap of an evil equine shapeshifter, 
                one day he found an apple and decided to eat it. 
                What he didnâ€™t know was that this apple was poisoned and that it would make him 
                fall from his magical pegasus world into the ordinary mule world. 
            </p>

                <p>
                    To return to his family, Toby must fight through levels of different
                    transformations, collect items, and defeat enemies using 
                    weapons and shields. The game has a single-player, sideways view, 
                    and features five levels of increasing difficulty.

            <h2 id="sub"> Mindset & Gameplay </h2>
            <p> The mindset we want to create for the players is for them
                 to have a sense of need to reunite Toby with his family. </p>
            <p> As they level up and unlock new features, we want them to 
                feel like they are becoming stronger and more capable of 
                overcoming challenges. As the player increases the level,
                 we want to challenge them with tough enemies and obstacles 
                 that will require them to think carefully about their 
                 tactics and strategies. </p>
            <p> The player will have to weight cons and pros of each item
                to get the best combination possible. They will be presented 
                with a series of decisions that will change the outcome of the game. 
                This will give the player the sense that he is in control of 
                his destiny.
                Overall, the goal is to create a game that is engaging and 
                immersive, that will make the player want to keep coming back
                 for more. Always keeping the game balanced between the 
                 sense of achievement and the need to win challenges. </p>

                <p> 
                    To create this beautiful game we took several references 
                    from different games, such as:                       
                </p>
                
                <!-- <img src="../images/Fireboy and Watergirl 1 OG Image.png"> </img> -->
                <p>
                    This game is called Fireboy and Watergirl in The Forest Temple. 
                    From this game we have taken the different obstacles the user has to go through.
                    Functionalities such as incentives to go through the obstacles were also taken into account.
                </p>
                <!-- <img src="../images/donkeyKong.jpg"> </img> -->
                <p>The game Donkey Kong inspired us for the type of
                visuals we wanted our game to have.
                Our characters and world, as the ones in Donkey Kong will be drawn with pixel art. </p>
