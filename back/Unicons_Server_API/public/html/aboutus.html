            <h2 id="sub"> Who are we? </h2>
            <p> We are a group of students from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez. </p>
            <p> We are currently taking the course of Software Engineering (COMP 4025) with professor Juan Carlos Ortiz. </p>
            <p> We are a group of 5 students, each one with a different role in the development of this game. </p>
            <p> We are all very excited to be working on this project and we hope you enjoy it as much as we do. </p>

            <h2 id="sub"> Mindset </h2>
            <p> The mindset we want to create for the players is for them
                 to have a sense of need to reunite Toby with his family. </p>
            <p> As they level up and unlock new features, we want them to feel like they are becoming stronger and more capable of overcoming challenges. As the player increases the level, we want to challenge them with tough enemies and obstacles that will require them to think carefully about their tactics and strategies. </p>
            <p> The player will have to weight cons and pros of each gadget to get the best combination possible. They will be presented with a series of decisions that will change the outcome of the game. 
                This will give the player the sense that he is in control of his destiny.
                Overall, the goal is to create a game that is engaging and immersive, that will make the player want to keep coming back for more. Always keeping the game balanced between the sense of achievement and the need to win challenges. </p>
